# Foliar-Fertigation-Exp
Our project applies two foliar fertigation methods, an automated environmental and physiological driven method vs. a constant rate fertigation system
# Introduction:

Foliar fertilization is a direct nutrient delivery method for elements with low mobility and availability in the soil-plant pathway. Minerals are absorbed through the leaves, ensuring efficient transport to their target sites. Since nutrient uptake occurs via stomata, wider stomatal openings enhance fertilization efficiency. In our project, we developed a system to foliar application methods. One system applies fertilization at conventional times, while the other uses environmental and physiological data to optimize timing, ensuring fertilization occurs precisely when stomata are open.
